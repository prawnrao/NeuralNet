# Toy Neural Network Library
## With a custom matrix math library.
My inspiration for this is The Coding Train (Daniel Shiffman) and his [Toy Neural Network](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS) library in javascript. He has a fantastic [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh) on YouTube in which he goes into detail of exactly how a Neural Network functions.

I also referenced the 3Blue1Brown's (Grant Sanderson's) [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) on YouTube, which is where I understood most of the underlying mathematics of Neural Networks.

Tariq Rashid's book [Make Your Own Neural Network](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G/) is also an excellent source of in depth underlying mathematics with more than enough explanation to understand the derivations. He also has a [github repo](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork) within which contains the code he has referenced in his book.

## Solved:
* Solving Xor

## Working on:
*  Google Quickdraw classification

## Future Work:

*  MINST Handwritten numbers
*  Refactor Code to allow more than 1 hidden layer.
